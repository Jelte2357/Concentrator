# Concentrator
App made for concentrating on your work (originally made as CS50 final project for Harvard Course)
Just open the app, it speaks for itself

Also as an exe, in the releases

## Note the binary will most likely be stopped by windows defender. It is safe, but if you still don't trust it, you can run the compile command I left in the repo.
